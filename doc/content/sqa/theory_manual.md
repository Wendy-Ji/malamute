# MALAMUTE Theory Manual

Background on the basis of MALAMUTE theory can be found throughout the standard user documentation.
Here, we highlight several locations of interest for MALAMUTE theory:

- Documentation for all MALAMUTE input file objects, and how they can be used in the creation of a
  multiphysics simulation, is contained in the [syntax/index.md] page.
- MALAMUTE verification and validation cases, along with associated documentation, can be found in
  the [malamute_vvr.md].

<!--TODO: add link to demonstration cases page here when that page is not just an empty placeholder-->
